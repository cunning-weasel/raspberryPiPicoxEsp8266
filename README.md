# raspberryPiPico x Esp8266
setup of raspberry pi pico (non wifi) connecting up to the ESP8266 12E D1 Mini. ESP8266 acts as the access point for picoo to run a c based web server.
WIP, but ultimately, the device is intended to be used to pick up blackouts, notify users via telegram/ email that there's an electricity cut, and the device should trigger a set of instructions so as to time the blackout, keep a log of this data and predict when and how long the next blackout will be.
