# raspberryPiPico x Esp8266
setup of raspberry pi pico w & ESP8266 12E D1 Mini. 

~~Connect the ESP8266 and the Raspberry Pi Pico via jumper cables on a breadboard.~~<br>
Have the ESP8266 forward incoming commands to Raspberry Pi Pico over UART.<br>
Have the Raspberry Pi Pico send commands back to the ESP8266 over UART <br>
Can have the pico actually running a simple server i.e (https://github.com/cunning-weasel/weasel_server/tree/main) or whatever can work as a proof of concept
Connect microchips to the home network to allow for hosting
P.S doesn't need to be server code running on pico - happy to have a compiled Doom as such that the microchips can be seen as a simple console for users to connect on the same network and have access to (multiplayer?) doom i.e: https://blog.cloudflare.com/doom-multiplayer-workers/
